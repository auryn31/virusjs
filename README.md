# Security flaw

Show if you would be infected by a virus in npm preinstall scripts [npm info](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141702881055/package-install-scripts-vulnerability).
The same for yarn [yarn](https://medium.com/@kyle_martin/understanding-and-protecting-against-malicious-npm-package-lifecycle-scripts-8b6129619d7c).

This is not a real virus, it only shows you, what would happen if it was.
